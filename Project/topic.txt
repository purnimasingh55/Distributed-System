Currently, gaming is a large source of bandwidth and programming resources. Games that
can be played over the Internet are very popular. A project could be done on what is required
to run games like that over a network. Programming styles could be investigated as well (i.e.,
what language is usually used, what type of message passing/shared memory is used, etc). A
game like this is not a true operating system in itself but is still an example of distributed
computing. The only motivation for a project like this is that it could be interesting and fun.
